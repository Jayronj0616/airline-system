NOTES & TIPS
=================================================================

1. Start with features that show different skills
   - Data visualization (charts)
   - Background processing (queues)
   - Real-time features (WebSockets)
   - API integrations (external services)
   
2. Focus on user-facing features first
   - Users care about UX more than admin features
   - Better for portfolio screenshots/demos
   
3. Document everything
   - README with setup instructions
   - Feature documentation
   - API documentation (if building API)
   - Screenshots/GIFs of features
   
4. Consider your target audience
   - Applying for frontend role? → Focus on UX/UI features
   - Backend role? → Focus on complex logic/optimization
   - Full-stack role? → Balance of both
   
5. Quality > Quantity
   - 5 well-implemented features > 20 half-done features
   - Make sure each feature is production-ready
   - Write tests for critical functionality
